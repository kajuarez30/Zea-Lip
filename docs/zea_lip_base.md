## Abstract

Glycerolipids are the predominant building block of non-plastidic membranes thus essential for plant growth and development. To better understand how a specific genome sequence results in certain lipid phenotypes we need to explore the temporal and spatial patterns of these metabolites. In this study we present leaf lipid profiles of three   different genotypes (B73, Palomero Toluqueño and CML312) at different developmental stages and along three different leaf zones.

## Introduction

In *Zea mays*, and monocots in general, the leaf differentiation occurs basipetally, having the less differentiated cells  in the tip and the most differentiated ones in the base (Sharman 1942; Nelson and Dengler 1997). This continuous developmental gradient represents a good model to investigate the lipid differentiation among leaves in different developmental stage and different zones within the leaves.
In previous studies of maize global RNA sequencing it has been reported that there is a very contrasting expression pattern between tip and base of maize leaves in same or different developmental stages (Sekhon et al. 2011; Stelpflug et al. 2016).  Moreover, Li and collaborators found that based on morphological, anatomical and physiological characteristics maize leaf blade can be divided into four zones, which are representative samples for the study of photosynthetic differentiation in maize leaves (Li et al. 2010). Based on those two different approaches we defined three different developmental zones within maize leaves Figure 1B.


## Materials and Methods  

### Plant material and growth conditions
The plant material used in this study consisted of Mexi 5 Palomero Toluqueño (mexican highland landrace), B73 and CML312, the latter being a tropical line developed by CIMMYT. All seeds were weighed before planting. These varieties of maize were planted in a greenhouse in four different blocks, each block with 10 days of difference in between sowing dates and each block had two replicates of each genotype. A randomized block design was employed. The plants were watered with 500 mL of tap water every third day.
After germination, the growth was daily measured in terms of number of emerging leaves and fully expanded leaves by plant (Figure A). The vegetative stage used describes the number of leaf counting the coleoptiles as the first one (Sharman 1942).
All blocks were harvested 50 days after germination (dag) of block 1, harvested tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until extraction.
From block 1, leaves were sampled in three different zones: base (B), center (C) and tip (T ), see Figure X. From each zone 50 mg of fresh blade tissue were collected for lipid extraction, excluding the mid rib.
