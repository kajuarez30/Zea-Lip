## Abstract

Glycerolipids are the predominant building block of non-plastidic membranes thus essential for plant growth and development. To better understand how a specific genome sequence results in certain lipid phenotypes we need to explore the temporal and spatial patterns of these metabolites. In this study we present leaf lipid profiles of three   different genotypes (B73, Palomero Toluqueño and CML312) at different developmental stages and along three different leaf zones.
