*Zea Lip*: An atlas of glycerolipid species across development in maize B73, CML312 inbreds and Palomero Toluqueño landrace.
-----------------------------

Here we present a developmental atlas of maize glycerolipid species. We collected tissues from three  maize lines: B73, CML312 and Palomero Toluqueño at different developmental stages, leaf types and areas of the leaf. We then analyzed this tissues using HPLC-MS and identified 150 glycerolipid species.
